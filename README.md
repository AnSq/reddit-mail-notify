reddit-mail-notify
==================

Status bar icon and popup notification for new reddit messages. Or rather it will be.

Currently you can run it from the terminal and it will tell you how many unread messages you have. By default it will prompt you for a username and password, or you can make a `praw.ini` file that looks like this:

	[DEFAULT]
	user=<username>
	pswd=<password>
